Installation
************

We recommend you use `Anaconda <https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/>`_ to install
the necessary requirements for Starkit to work.

Once you have anaconda installed please make a new environment with the prerequisites
for starkit in the following way. This will create an environment called `starkit`::

    curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/starkit/starkit/master/starkit_env3.yml
    
    # install using yml file into an environment called starkit. 
    # If you want to call it something else, or already have a starkit enivornment, 
    # you can change the -n argument
    
    conda env create --file starkit_env3.yml -n starkit
    source activate starkit

For now until a new version of Astropy comes out that fixes some problems of memory leak, you need to do::

    conda install cython
    pip install specutils

Then you can additionally install any other packages you like with::
  
    conda install <your package>

Once this is installed, there are two ways to install starkit. For simple use::

    pip install git+https://github.com/starkit/starkit

To download a full development version of starkit, please do::

    git clone https://github.com/starkit/starkit
    cd starkit
    python setup.py develop
